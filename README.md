Hello. My name is Ilya and I am a beginner programmer.

At the moment, I am actively studying one of the most demanded programming languages - Python. üêç
I prefer writing backends for websites, but I also develop potihonics in neural networks and data science. ü§ñ
Subsequently, I want to switch to another more complex programming language like C ++ and Java, in order to try all the diversity in IT. 
This github is designed to store all of my significant projects, so don't be surprised if you see the code of an outright newbie here. 
I hope I am interested in you as a developer. 

Thanks for stopping by‚ù§
